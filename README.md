# reminder-rs
Reminder Bot for Discord, now in Rust.
Old Python version: https://github.com/reminder-bot/bot

## What is this?
This is a rewrite of Reminder Bot in Rust, using Serenity and SQLx amongst other libraries.

## Why is this?
Serenity and Rust are proving wonders for SoundFX. This is all in an effort to reduce resource consumption and improve performance.

## How do I use it?
You'll need rustc and cargo for compilation. To run, you'll need Python 3 still (due to no suitable replacement for dateparser in Rust)

TODO fill out the rest of this
